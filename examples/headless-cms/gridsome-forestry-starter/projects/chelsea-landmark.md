The **banana** fruits grow from a **banana** blossom in hanging clusters, also called a bunch or **banana** stem. The fruits grow in rows called tiers or hands. There can be as many as twenty fruits to a hand, and as many as twenty tiers in a bunch. A bunch usually weighs between 30 and 50 kilograms (65 to 110 pounds).
