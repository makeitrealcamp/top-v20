# Brief

In this project, we're creating a Tip Calculator.

<img src="./preview.png">

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- Calculate tip based on tip percentage, bill amount, and number of people


# Getting Started

1. To get started folder. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file (that's this!). It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work in **classroom**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
- Add an additional checkbox to the top of the list, with the ability to check or uncheck all items at once.
- Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file.

# FAQs

- Can I use libraries / frameworks on these projects?
  - Of course! We're providing the vanilla HTML and CSS, but you can use whatever tools and frameworks you'd like.
- Can I use this project in my portfolio?
  - Sure! But, be honest about the work that _you_ did
